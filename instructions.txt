RECIPE: KEY LIME PIE 

Ingredients
300g oatmeal biscuits
110g butter, melted
1 x 397g can condensed milk (we used Nestl√©)
3 medium egg yolks
finely grated zest and juice of 4 limes
300ml double cream
1 tbsp icing sugar
extra lime zest, to decorate

Method
STEP 1
Heat the oven to 160C/fan 140C/gas 3.

STEP 2
Whizz 300g oatmeal biscuits to crumbs in a food processor (or put in a strong plastic bag and bash with a rolling pin).

STEP 3
Mix with 110g melted butter and press into the base and up the sides of a 22cm loose-based tart tin. Bake in the oven for 10 minutes. Remove and cool.

STEP 4
Put 3 medium egg yolks in a large bowl and whisk for a minute with electric beaters.

STEP 5
Add a can of condensed milk and whisk for 3 minutes, then add the finely grated zest and juice of 4 limes and whisk again for 3 minutes.

STEP 6
Pour the filling into the cooled base then put back in the oven for 15 minutes. Cool then chill for at least 6 hours or overnight if you like. When you are ready to serve, carefully remove the pie from the tin and put on a serving plate.

STEP 7
To decorate, softly whip together 300ml double cream and 1 tbsp icing sugar.

STEP 8
Dollop or pipe the cream onto the top of the pie and finish with extra lime zest.
